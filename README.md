# Application Project
To run the start program that will initialize both node scripts you must first run "chmod u+x start.bash". Then to run the script you run "./start.bash TICKER" with TICKER replaced with the cryptocurrency pair (e.g."BTCUSD"). Use https://docs.bitfinex.com/v2/reference#ws-public-ticker as a reference if needed.
